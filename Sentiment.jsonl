Others argue the merger\n  was more cost effective than creating a comparable branch\n  network from scratch.\n      The analysts agreed the bank was aggressive. It has\n  expanded overseas, entered the lucrative securities business\n  and geared up for domestic competition, but they questioned the\n  wisdom of some of those moves.\n      \"They've made bold moves to put everything in place. Now\n  it's largely out of their hands,\" said Kleinwort Benson Ltd\n  financial analyst Simon Smithson.\n      Among Sumitomo's problems are limits placed on its move to\n  enter U.S. Securities business by taking a share in American\n  investment bank Goldman, Sachs and Co.\n      Sumitomo last August agreed to pay 500 mln dlrs for a 12.5\n  pct limited partnership in the bank, but for the time being at\n  least, the Federal Reserve Board has forbidden them to exchange\n  personnel, or increase the business they do with each other.\n      \"The tie-up is widely looked on as a lame duck because the\n  Fed was stricter than Sumitomo expected,\" said one analyst.\n      But Komatsu said the move will pay off in time.\n      \"U.S. Regulations will change in the near future and if so,\n  we can do various things. We only have to wait two or three\n  years, not until the 21st century,\" Komatsu said.\n      Komatsu is also willing to be patient about possible routes\n  into the securities business at home.\n      Article 65 of the Securities and Exchange Act, Japan's\n  version of the U.S. Glass-Steagall Act, separates commercial\n  from investment banking.\n      But the walls between the two are crumbling and Komatsu\n  said he hopes further deregulation will create new\n  opportunities.\n      \"We need to find new business chances,\" Komatsu said. \"In some\n  cases these will be securities related, in some cases trust\n  bank related. That's the kind of deregulation we want.\"\n      Until such changes occur, Sumitomo will focus on such\n  domestic securities business as profitable government bond\n  dealing and strengthening relations with Meiko Securities Co\n  Ltd, in which it holds a five pct share, Komatsu said.\n      He said Sumitomo is cautiously optimistic about entering\n  the securities business here through its Swiss universal bank\n  subsidiary, Banca del Gottardo.\n       The Finance Ministry is expected to grant licences to\n  securities subsidiaries of U.S. Commercial banks soon,\n  following a similar decision for subsidiaries of European\n  universal banks in which the parent holds a less than 50 pct.\n      But Komatsu is reluctant to push hard for a similar\n  decision on a Gottardo subsidiary.\n      \"We don't want to make waves. We expect this will be allowed\n  in two or three years,\" he said.\n      Like other city banks, Sumitomo is also pushing to expand\n  lending to individuals and small and medium businesses to\n  replace disappearing demand from big business, he added.\n      The analysts said Sumitomo will have to devote a lot of\n  time to digesting its most recent initiatives, including the\n  merger with ailing Heiwa Sogo.\n      \"It's (Sumitomo) been bold in its strategies,\" said\n  Kleinwort's Smithson.\n      \"After that, it's a question of absorbing and juggling\n  around.

{"prompt": "Please classify the sentiment of the following news article as positive or negative:\n\nENERGY/U.S. PETROCHEMICAL INDUSTRY\n  Cheap oil feedstocks, the weakened U.S.\n  dollar and a plant utilization rate approaching 90 pct will\n  propel the streamlined U.S. petrochemical industry to record\n  profits this year, with growth expected through at least 1990,\n  major company executives predicted.\n      This bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and an\n  industrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted GAF\n  Corp &lt;GAF>, privately-held Cain Chemical Inc, and other firms\n  to aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants.\n      Oil companies such as Ashland Oil Inc &lt;ASH>, the\n  Kentucky-based oil refiner and marketer, are also shopping for\n  money-making petrochemical businesses to buy.\n      \"I see us poised at the threshold of a golden period,\" said\n  Paul Oreffice, chairman of giant Dow Chemical Co &lt;DOW>, adding,\n  \"There's no major plant capacity being added around the world\n  now. The whole game is bringing out new products and improving\n  the old ones.\"\n      Analysts say the chemical industry's biggest customers,\n  automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot of\n  paints and plastics, are expected to buy quantities this year.\n      U.S. petrochemical plants are currently operating at about\n  90 pct capacity, reflecting tighter supply that could hike\n  product prices by 30 to 40 pct this year, said John Dosher,\n  managing director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston. Demand\n  for some products such as styrene could push profit margins up\n  by as much as 300 pct, he said.\n      Oreffice, speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers in\n  Houston, said Dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earned\n  last year and predicted it would have the best year in its\n  history.\n      In 1985, when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barrel\n  and chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong U.S.\n  dollar, Dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs. \"I believe the entire\n  chemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it,\"\n  Oreffice said.\n      GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the U.S. chemical\n  industry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987.\n  Last year, the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billion\n  dlrs, a 54 pct leap from 1985.\n      The turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemical\n  industry has been brought about by a combination of luck and\n  planning, said Pace's John Dosher.\n      Dosher said last year's fall in oil prices made feedstocks\n  dramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollar\n  was weakening against foreign currencies. That helped boost\n  U.S. chemical exports.\n      Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has\n  been the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical\n  manufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producers\n  in the early 1980s.\n      Finally, virtually all major U.S. chemical manufacturers\n  have embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring program\n  to mothball inefficient plants, trim the payroll and eliminate\n  unrelated businesses. The restructuring touched off a flurry of\n  friendly and hostile takeover attempts.\n      GAF, which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquire\n  Union Carbide Corp &lt;UK>, recently offered three billion dlrs\n  for Borg Warner Corp &lt;BOR>, a Chicago manufacturer of plastics\n  and chemicals. Another industry powerhouse, W.R. Grace &lt;GRA> \n  has divested its retailing, restaurant and fertilizer\n  businesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions.\n      But some experts worry that the chemical industry may be\n  headed for trouble if companies continue turning their back on\n  the manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities, such as\n  ethylene, in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals that\n  are custom-designed for a small group of buyers.\n      \"Companies like DuPont &lt;DD> and Monsanto Co &lt;MTC> spent the\n  past two or three years trying to get out of the commodity\n  chemical business in reaction to how badly the market had\n  deteriorated,\" Dosher said. \"But I think they will eventually\n  kill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche\n  market.\" Some top chemical executives share the concern.\n      \"The challenge for our industry is to keep from getting\n  carried away and repeating past mistakes,\" GAF's Heyman\n  cautioned. \"The shift from commodity chemicals may be\n  ill-advised. Specialty businesses do not stay special long.\"\n      Houston-based Cain Chemical, created this month by the\n  Sterling investment banking group, believes it can generate 700\n  mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend.\n      Chairman Gordon Cain, who previously led a leveraged buyout\n  of Dupont's Conoco Inc's chemical business, has spent 1.1\n  billion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plants\n  along the Texas Gulf Coast.\n      The plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals that\n  are the building blocks of specialty products.\n      \"This kind of commodity chemical business will never be a\n  glamorous, high-margin business,\" Cain said, adding that demand\n  is expected to grow by about three pct annually.\n      Garo Armen, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said\n  chemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand for\n  plastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum, wood\n  and steel products. Armen estimated the upturn in the chemical\n  business could last as long as four or five years, provided the\n  U.S. economy continues its modest rate of growth.\n  \n\n", "completion": "Sentiment: positive\n"}

The\n  company still planned to invest 700 mln guilders this year in\n  restructuring and marketing, Heineken said.\n      Heineken's Spanish activities should start yielding profit\n  next year, Heineken said, adding that its French operations had\n  already turned to profit after vast rationalization last year.\n      Vice Chairman Gerard van Schaik said the decision by the\n  European Court of Justice in Luxembourg to allow foreign beer\n  into the closed West German market -- Europe's biggest beer\n  market -- offered interesting possibilities for Heineken. \"We\n  have the beer, but distribution and sales is the important\n  point,\" van Schaik said, adding that since the ruling Heineken\n  had been inundated by German traders seeking joint ventures.\n      \"The question is not if we want to penetrate the German\n  market, but how we are to do it,\" van Schaik said, adding that\n  while the widely traveled Germans seemed to be developing a\n  taste for foreign beer, the internal structure was very\n  regionalized.\n       Heineken board member Hans Coebergh, responsible for\n  African operations, said he saw Africa as one of the most\n  important beer growth markets in the long term.\n       He said the company, present in Africa since 1932 and with\n  majority stakes in six breweries and interests in 25, was\n  hampered by the lack of hard currencies there.\n      Africa, where beer consumption averages only nine liters\n  per head per year and sales are limited by import restrictions\n  and currency risks, nonetheless accounted for 6.5 pct of total\n  1986 sales.\n      On-site production is rendered expensive by the high price\n  of imports of essential ingredients. But Heineken scientists\n  have been looking at other possibilities.\n      To balance the costs of imported malt, Heinken launched on\n  the Nigerian market a new beer made of 50 pct sorghum, which\n  had sold successfully, Coebergh said.\n      Heineken is urging farmers to grow the traditional raw\n  materials, but Coebergh noted that banana and palm beer were\n  popular in Rwanda . \"This is a possibility, but we could not\n  possibly achieve the Heineken flavor,\" Coebergh said.\n      Chairman Heineken said the company's seven year efforts to\n  penetrate the Soviet market had finally resulted this week in a\n  contract that relaxed some of the restrictions they faced.\n      But again, a lack of hard currencies limited Heineken's\n  market potential. Heineken now has seven bars in Moscow that\n  are enjoying good sales, but the bars only accept western\n  money.\n  \n\n", "completion": "Sentiment: positive.\n"}

Campeau bought the rest at 69 dlrs a share.\n      The SEC said it had planned to file a court brief joining\n  with Allied in charging that Campeau had engaged in an illegal\n  tender offer.\n      But the SEC brief was never filed since the case was\n  dropped following an agreement between Campeau and DeBartolo.\n      In the administrative proceeding against Allied and Kern,\n  the SEC is asking for an administrative order that they comply\n  with reporting provisions of securities laws in the future.\n      Although Allied is no longer publicly traded since it\n  became a subsidiary of Campeau, it still files annual and\n  quarterly reports to the SEC because it has outstanding debt.\n  \n\n", "completion": "Sentiment: negative.\n"}
